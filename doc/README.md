This directory contains information on `kotnetcli`'s' internals. It's intended for developers.

- `sw_design.md` documents the overall software design in a textual format, combined with UML diagrams.
- `extending.md` sketches how to incorporate several possible extensions in `kotnetcli`'s software design.
- `kotnetcli_modelio_project` is a directory containing the [modelio](https://www.modelio.org/) project that generated the UML diagrams.


**NOTE**: `kotnetcli`'s software design process follows a bottom-up open source spirit. Developers are encouraged to participate in the design process, to propose enhancements, discuss caveats, enhance the documentation, etc. All diagrams presented here are created with the free  software tool [`modelio`](https://www.modelio.org/). The project is included in the `kotnetcli_modelio_project` directory.
